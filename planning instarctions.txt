-----------------------------------------

Drag & Drop Library: I will use @hello-pangea/dnd (maintained fork of react-beautiful-dnd) for better React 18 support.

State Management: Will use React Context for Auth and local state for Todos/Kanban to keep it simple.

Styling: Will use MUI's

-----------------------------------------

SSR & Dnd: Will wrap the Kanban board in a client-only component to prevent hydration errors.
MikroORM: Will ensure RequestContext is forked per API request to prevent data leaks.
Styling: Will use MUI's ThemeProvider for the dark/light mode and consistent domain colors.

-----------------------------------------

Menu Interpretation: "Create" and "Delete" in the menu will be implemented as a "Create New" modal trigger and a "Recycle Bin" or "Bulk Delete" view respectively, to keep the UI logical.
JWT Handling: Axios will automatically attach the Authorization header to requests and handle token storage upon successful login response.

------------------------------------------
1.
